# Merchant-Service
In this project, I customized a WordPress theme with custom styles, meta tags, and image preloading. I optimized scripts, modified WooCommerce image sizes, pricing, and product tabs, and added custom layouts. Customized variation pricing, displayed minimum prices, and ensured correct price display with sale messages.
