# Merchant-Service
In this project, I have customized a WordPress theme by enqueuing custom styles, adding meta tags, preloading images, and optimizing scripts. Modified WooCommerce image sizes, pricing display, and product tabs. Also enhanced AMP pages, removed unused assets, and optimized performance with custom functions.
